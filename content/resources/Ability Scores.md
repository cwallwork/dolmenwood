#### Modifiers

Ability scores add (or subtract) modifiers to damage rolls.
The modifier is calculated (ability score - 10)/2
For ability scores above 12 or above, this will result in a positive modifier. For ability scores 8 or below, this will result in a negative modifier.
Modifiers are rounded to the smallest absolute value, i.e. -1 rounds to 0, +1 rounds to 0. -2 rounds to -1, +2 rounds to +1.

Add the STR modifier to melee damage for slow (d10), and balanced (d8) weapons.

Add the DEX modifier to melee damage for quick (d6) weapons and ranged attacks.

Unarmed and improvised (1d4)  may use _either_ STR _or_ DEX modifiers, but not both.

Add the WIL modifier to the SUM of spell rolls, and rolls to avoid spell miscasts.
