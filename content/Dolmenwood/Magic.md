Decide how many dice you are going to use to cast your spell. Some spells may have a minimum number of dice that you must use to successfully cast the spell. The maximum number of dice that a beginning character can use is four. You cannot use more dice than you have empty inventory slots. To use more than four dice the character must get specialized training, or find some other in-game method to increase ability their to use magic.

**Spell Descriptions**
Some spells have variable effects based on the number and sum of the dice. In the descriptions these will be noted as SUM and DICE.

**Rolling the dice**
Roll the selected number of magic dice. If any of the dice are repeated (i.e. two 4s, three 2s, two 2s and two sixes), then the spell has become unstable and the caster must roll to control it.

To successfully control the spell: Roll a WIL check against a target of 12 + the number of matching dice.
**Example:** Zappa is attempting to cast a three die fireball. They roll a 6 and two 1s. Zappa must make a WIL check (WIL + d20) and beat a target number of 14 (12 + 2 for the repeated 1s).

If the check is failed, the player must roll on the [[magical mishap table]].
Magical mishaps do not always result in the failure of the spell.

**Fatigue**
Whether the spell is successfully cast or not, the character takes one fatigue for each 4,5 or 6 rolled.
### Holy magic is incompatible with other types of magic

Any character that has access to holy magic (cleric spells), may not use arcane or other types of magic. If they do, their deity will remove their ability to cast holy spells, or to receive holy blessings

The ability to cast holy magic may be regained by performing a service for the church as penance.

Limited exceptions may be made if the use of arcane magic is of significant benefit to the church.
