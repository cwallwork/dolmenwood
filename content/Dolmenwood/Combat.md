Before damage is rolled, Player Characters under attack have the following options:
#### Defend 
The character tries to defend themselves without taking any particular risks
or trying any moves. This is resolved by simply taking the damage to HP — the default
option.
#### Fight Back
The defender chooses one attacker and makes an attack, after they've
taken the incoming damage. Fighting back incurs 1 Fatigue.
#### Block
Incoming Fast (d6) or Balanced (d8) attacks become Impaired. To block, the
defender must wield a balanced or slow weapon or a shield. Blocking incurs 1
Fatigue, unless it is performed with a shield or slow weapon while wearing heavy
armor (3 Armor), in which case it incurs no Fatigue.
#### Dodge
Any incoming Slow (d10) or Balanced (d8) attacks become Impaired. It is not
possible to dodge in heavy armor (3 Armor) or while wielding a slow weapon.
Dodging incurs 1 Fatigue, unless it is performed with a fast weapon (or unarmed)
while wielding light (1 Armor) or no Armor, in which case it incurs no Fatigue.
#### Parry
The defender chooses one attacking opponent that they are able to attack in
return and make an opposed roll.
- If the defender rolls higher than the attacker, the attacker's dice
roll is invalidated, and the defender deals their damage straight to the attacker's
STR.
- If the attacker rolls higher, the damage is dealt to the defender's STR instead.
- If the two rolls are equal, both weapons bounce off each other. No damage is done to either party.

Each of these options is essentially a reaction — they happen in the split-second in
which a character is attacked. Some enemies might also have access to these abilities
as well. Note that an attacking creature cannot take a reaction; if an orc blademaster
strikes at a PC and the PC fights back, the orc cannot block or take similar reactions, as
that could create an infinite chain of reactions.

### Damage
HP represents the character's ability to avoid harm. While the character is at or above 0 HP, they have not be physically harmed.

Once a character's HP have been depleted, any additional damage is done to their STR stat. Once the damage
