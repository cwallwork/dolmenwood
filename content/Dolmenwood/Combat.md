### Attacking
There are no "to-hit" rolls, only damage rolls. HP represents a character's ability to fend off harm during the fight. They do not take physical damage until 0 HP is reached. Damage is reduced by armor.

### Move order
On their turn, if a character or NPC chooses to attack with a melee weapon, attack resolution is determined like so:

If the attacker has to move before they are within striking distance of the target, Slow (d10) weapons are resolved before Balanced (d8) weapons, which are resolved before Quick (d6) weapons.

If the attacker is already in melee range, Quick weapons go first, followed by Balanced weapons, with Slow weapons going last.
### Maneuvers
Before damage is rolled, Player Characters under attack have the following options:
#### Defend 
The character tries to defend themselves without taking any particular risks
or trying any moves. This is resolved by simply taking the damage to HP — the default
option.
#### Fight Back
The defender chooses one attacker and makes an attack, after they've
taken the incoming damage. Fighting back incurs 1 Fatigue.
#### Block
Incoming Fast (d6) or Balanced (d8) attacks become Impaired. To block, the
defender must wield a balanced or slow weapon or a shield. Blocking incurs 1
Fatigue, unless it is performed with a shield or slow weapon while wearing heavy
armor (3 Armor), in which case it incurs no Fatigue.
#### Dodge
Any incoming Slow (d10) or Balanced (d8) attacks become Impaired. It is not
possible to dodge in heavy armor (3 Armor) or while wielding a slow weapon.
Dodging incurs 1 Fatigue, unless it is performed with a fast weapon (or unarmed)
while wielding light (1 Armor) or no Armor, in which case it incurs no Fatigue.
#### Parry
The defender chooses one attacking opponent that they are able to attack in
return and make an opposed roll.
- If the defender rolls higher than the attacker, the attacker's dice
roll is invalidated, and the defender deals their damage straight to the attacker's
STR.
- If the attacker rolls higher, the damage is dealt to the defender's STR instead.
- If the two rolls are equal, both weapons bounce off each other. No damage is done to either party.

Each of these options is essentially a reaction — they happen in the split-second in
which a character is attacked. Some enemies might also have access to these abilities
as well. Note that an attacking creature cannot take a reaction; if an orc blademaster
strikes at a PC and the PC fights back, the orc cannot block or take similar reactions, as
that could create an infinite chain of reactions.

### Damage
HP represents the character's ability to avoid harm. While the character is at or above 0 HP, they have not been physically injured.

Once a character's HP have been depleted, any additional damage is done to their STR stat. Any time a character takes damage to their STR stat, they must roll a STR save. 
If they succeed the save, they roll on the Light Wound table.
If they fail the save, they roll on the Critical Wound table.

If a character reaches 0 STR, they are dead.
