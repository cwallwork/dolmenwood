### Checks
Roll 1d20 and add your modifier. The DM will tell you if you succeed or not.
A roll of a natural 20 can indicate a Critical Success. A natural one can indicate an exceptional failure, also called a Fumble.
#### Modifiers

Ability scores add (or subtract) modifiers to damage rolls.
The modifier is calculated (ability score - 10)/2
For ability scores above 12 or above, this will result in a positive modifier. For ability scores 8 or below, this will result in a negative modifier.
Modifiers are rounded to the smallest absolute value, i.e. -1 rounds to 0, +1 rounds to 0. -2 rounds to -1, +2 rounds to +1.

Add the STR modifier to melee damage for slow (d10), and balanced (d8) weapons.

Add the DEX modifier to melee damage for quick (d6) weapons and ranged attacks.

Unarmed and improvised (1d4)  may use _either_ STR _or_ DEX modifiers, but not both.

Add the WIL modifier to the SUM of spell rolls, and rolls to avoid spell miscasts.
### Saves
Make a roll-under save to avoid a bad thing happening. This system is similar to games like Cairn, or 1st and 2nd edition Dungeons and Dragons.
If a character is at risk, the DM will call for a save against the relevant stat. The player rolls 1d20, and is aiming to roll equal or lower than their ability score.
