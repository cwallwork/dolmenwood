## __Principles__

### Living World
Their is no set plot, and the players are free to follow what interests them. All of the factions have their own desires and plans, and will attempt to fulfill them. The players may choose to help or hinder them as they see fit.
### Foreground growth and levelling
There is no explicit levelling, where a character gets a jump in abilities after beating a number of monsters or accumulating an amount of gold. Characters advance through interacting with the game world, having adventures and pursuing their own goals.
### Combat as war, not as sport
There is no explicit reward for killing monsters or NPCs. Combat is deadly and unpredictable. If you have no choice but to use physical violence, stack the odds in your favor. Set traps and ambushes. Never fight fair.

## __Character creation__
### Vocations over Classes
We are not playing with traditional classes. Players should choose one of the [[Vocations]] that offer skills and starting equipment. Characters are not tied to their vocation. If they wish they may follow another vocation through training and interest, or forge something completely unique.
### Unlocking kindreds
All starting characters are going to be human. As the players encounter the different sentient species in the Dolmenwood, they will be able to create characters who belong to them.
### Troupe Play
Players start off with one character. Their may be times when their character is unavailable to be played (injured, occupied with a project, in a different location etc.). In this case it is useful for a player to have other characters available to play. Hirelings, apprentices, and friendly NPCs are all good options to play until the main character is available again.

## __Character Advancement__
### Gold is a good proxy for XP
While their is no explicit XP or leveling, attaining gold can be a route to increasing character power and capabilities. Characters can:

- Pay for training to increase stats, HP and skills
- Purchase magic items
- Use gold to curry favor and gain influence with factions
- Hire underlings or mercenaries, build fortifications, research technology
### Magic is out in the world
Magic using characters do not get to pick spells from a list during advancement. Magic can be gained is a few different ways:

- Finding scrolls and transcribing them into a spell book
- Paying a more powerful magic user to teach them a spell
- Gaining spells or magical items in exchange for performing services
- Praying one of the many shrines to receive a blessing in the form of a new spell
### Training
More mundane skills can be acquired through training with a proficient teacher. Some rough guidelines:

Become basically proficient: 1 month, 250GP, can learn from anyone proficient in the skill.
Advanced proficiency: 3 months  500GP, must find a dedicated teacher.
Expert proficiency: 6 months, 1000GP, must find a renowned teacher.
One of the greats in the field, 1 year or more, 2000GP or more, will have to undertake quests, must find a legend in the field willing to teach them.

These are cumulative, so to become an expert at horse riding would take 9 months of dedicated study, cost 1750GP, and require finding an expert at horsemanship to teach them.
